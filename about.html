<h2><p>MORE</p></h2>
<h4><p>I have a helminthophobia (phobia of worms). Among my siblings
I'm more comfortable to my brother than to my other siblings. I dont like noises, 
that's why I always wear my earphones. :) I get irritated and annoyed easily, 
well maybe it depends on the person. I love my Mom more than my Father, because my Father is 
so strict. I cry so easily.</p></h4>
